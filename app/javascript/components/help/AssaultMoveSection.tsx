      <h1>Assault Movement</h1>
      <p>
        Assault movement is a special form of{" "}
        <Link to={`/help/${helpIndexByName("Move").join(".")}`}>movement</Link>, i.e., an action
        that allows units to move from one hex to another, or perform other actions. It has very
        different rules than ordinary movement, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infantry units and vehicles may perform assault movement. Infantry manning crewed weapons
        may not assault move, nor may unmanned crewed weapons or infantry weapons that are not being
        carried by an infantry unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assault movement is a movement of one hex, regardless of terrain costs or unit movement
        points. Impassable terrain may not be entered, however, unless following a road (or a path
        if an infantry unit). Unlike movement, vehicles are not limited by their current facing and
        may assault move in any otherwise legal direction, and the vehicle will finish the assault
        movement facing along the direction of the move. If the unit has an armored turret, it may
        be rotated freely at the end of an assault move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infantry units may assault move individually or in a stack with other infantry units.
        Leaders have no special effects on assault movement. Vehicles can only assault move
        individually. A player may not move in such a way that would result in the stacking limit
        being exceeded unless entering an enemy occupied hex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike regular movement, units may enter enemy occupied hexes. This is the only way to
        initiate close combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no reaction fire after an assault move, only a regular initiative check. If the
        unit has a breakdown roll, perform a breakdown check before the initiative check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activated, exhausted, or broken units may not assault move. Pinned or immobilized units or
        units that otherwise have no movement points (i.e., tired and encumbered units with a
        resulting combined movement of zero) may not assault move. Mark units as exhausted after an
        assault move.
      </p>
      <p>
        If moving into a hex with enemy units, remove all tired, activated, or exhausted markers on
        units in that hex â€” units stacked with enemy units may no longer take any actions until the
        close combat is resolved.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional Actions</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering units (marked with a dot over their movement) may clear obstacles such as mines
        or wire if they start in the same turn with them. No dice roll is required, success is
        automatic. Remove the obstacle and end the move.
      </p>

        <div className="ml1em"></div>
        <div className="custom-button normal-button">

      </div>
      <p>
        Infantry squads or teams may entrench in most open terrain. The valid terrains are: open,
        brush, orchards, fields, or palm trees. Entrenchment is not possible in any other terrain,
        or if the base terrain is snow. Entrenchment is also not possible if other features
        (including both defensive features and obstacles) are present. No dice roll is required,
        success is automatic. Place a shell scrap in the hex beneath the unit(s) and end the move.
