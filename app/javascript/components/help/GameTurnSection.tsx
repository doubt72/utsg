      <p>
        Each game has a fixed number of turns, mostly in the main phase as initiative goes back and
        forth between the players. When all of the turns have been completed, the winner is
        determined based on objective victory points as well as points for units eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following sections of the documentation go into the details of the rules for how to play
        each turn and phase.

      <h2>Turn Sequence</h2>
