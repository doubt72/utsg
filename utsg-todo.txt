- Refactor Scenario Page:
  - Max widths for factions
  - Filter out alpha/beta/prototypes
  - Filter by Infantry Only, Infantry and Guns Only, Vehicles Only
  - Filter by Size
    15x11, 23x11, 15x21, 23x21, 31x21
  - Sort by...  Number? Map size?

- Fix terrain info over terrain (probably offset)
  - Also terrain help for ice
- Fix reinforcement panel drifting down
- Cancel direction if undo

- Fill Out Scenarios

- fix LOS error along firing arc in last image
- Improve layout of moves/chat on smaller screens
- Tooltips for map controls?

- Support mouse scroll on map
  - Much harder than it appears, need a way to intercept only scroll/wheel/key events
    but pass through all other mouse events

- Find undo bug on KV map/gun
  - probably a synchronization issue but haven't been able to reproduce
  - probably just switch to only load changes on synchronization

- Implement moves

- Switch main page game status to websocket

- fix text selection on select scenario maybe
