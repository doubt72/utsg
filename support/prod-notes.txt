Using DO rails droplet (specifically)

- rvm is installed, add ruby 3.2.2
- yarn is fine, but need node 22
  - install nvm/build node 22
    Why it doesn't work with 20.15.0 like it does in dev, no idea.
- bundle install
- <secret stored in secret location> for master.key
- set RAILS_ENV=production
- set AHTF_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<secret stored in secret location>
- install redis/redis-cli
- run 'rake db:create'
- run 'rake db:migrate'
- run 'rake assets:precompile'
- copy app/assets/images(/units) to /public/assets
  - Figure out how to deal with fingerprinting of images?  Or how not to fingerprint them at all

- rails.service to /etc/systemd/system/
- rails-nginx (as rails) to /etc/nginx/sites-available/
